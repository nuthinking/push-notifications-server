# Node.JS Push Notification Server #

Real-time notification server built on top of Node.JS. Started from the code used for http://chat.nodejs.org/ added room option to control multiple devices.

Load the page passing "room" and "client" properties (e.g.: http://127.0.0.1:31267/?clientName=client&room=test) and then using the keyboard to send the pressed char to the other connected clients.
